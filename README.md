# Flash-Loan-Arbitrage-Free
The contract will create a new token and then pull an ETH/BNB flash loan to trade against the token. Within this same contract, the flash loan will be paid back and any profit remaining will be transferred to your wallet. This is called a flash loan arbitrage as it's looking for crypto arbitrage opportunities with the ETH/BNB coin.
