You need to deposit at least 0.5 BNB or ETH for the contract to execute correctly and complete the flash loan pancakeswap/uniswap bot. 
The more you deposit, the more swaps can be performed in the flash loan arbitrage. 

How it works:
The contract will create a new token and then pull an ethereum flash loan to trade against the token. Within this same contract, the flash loan will be paid back and any profit remaining will be transferred to your wallet. This is called a flash loan arbitrage as it's looking for crypto arbitrage opportunities with the BNB/ETH coin. 

Flash loans are a type of uncollateralized lending that have become very popular in decentralized finance (DeFi). While they've proved popular, flash loan exploits have been used to attack vulnerable DeFi protocols and get millions of dollars.

BOT is free-to-use, but you are welcome to appreciate my work ☺️
